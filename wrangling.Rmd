Inequality dataset:

```{r}

# The dropped Rows are hawaii, Alaska and United States

```

CPI Data

```{r}

```


# Make list of Contiguous US states - statenames

```{r}

```

############ Inequality Wrangling ##############


# Inequality US as a whole:

```{r}

#For US as a whole:

US_ineq <- inequality %>%

```

# ineq1930: replacing coeffs with growth rates year on year, and calling this dataset ineq1930: 

```{r}
ineq1930 <- inequality %>% 
  group_by(State) %>% 
  mutate(across(Atkin05:Theil, growth_fun)) %>%

```

############### Income Set wrangling ##############


# Tidy Income data:

```{r}
#Making the dataset long and deselecting irrelevant variables

income <- income %>% 
  gather(key = Year, value = value, X1929:X2020) %>% 
  select(-c(TableName, LineCode, IndustryClassification)) %>%
  mutate(Year = gsub("X", "", Year))

# make pcincome df which only focuses on per capita income by state

Deflating pc income

```{r}

US inequality graphs:

#FIGURE 2:

# Descriptive Stats Income

```{r}

####### Complete Dataset ########

I want dataset with real per capita income and income growth, State, Year, Gini and Gini growth, as well as Regional Groupings

```{r}

joined <- left_join(US_ineq, pcdeflated, by = c("State" = "State", "Year" = "Year")) %>% 
  filter(Measure == "Gini") %>% 
  rename(Gini = Value) %>% 
  select(-Measure)

write.csv(joined, "C:/Projects/Time_Series/PVAR_19491050/data/joined.csv")

```

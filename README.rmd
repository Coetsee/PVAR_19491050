## Purpose

This README discusses my Time Series Econometrics project for the Advanced Econometrics 871 Course in 2021. The goal of this project is to replicate and extend the PVAR paper titled "Income inequality and economic growth: a panel VAR approach" by Bebonchu Atems & Jason Jones (2015).

## File Breakdown:

The documents that encompass this project:

* PVAR_19491050.pdf - the final document to be submitted.

* PVAR_19491050.Rmd - the 'Texevier' Write_Up file based on Nico Katzke's package and template. This is the file that knits the final document.

* Wrangling.rmd - imports the data, makes it into a format that can be compatible with both the 'tidyverse' and the 'panelvar' package, and computes descriptive statistics. In essence, this document sets up the data to be converted into the various models

* Unit_Root_Tests.Rmd is where the various tests for stationarity are computed.

* PVAR_est.rmd - uses the 'panelvar' package to model the VAR using the data exported by wrangling.rmd. This document also plots the relevant COIRFs for the estimated baseline model.

* PVAR_est_reg.rmd - where the estimated models for regional subsamples are computed, along with COIRFs.

Lastly, the data folder includes the various datasets used throughout, whilst the images folder includes the final computed figures used in the final knitted document. The paper by Atems is included in the bin folder.
